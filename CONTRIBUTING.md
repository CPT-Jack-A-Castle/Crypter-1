# Contributing

Thank you for showing an interest in contributing to this project.  Extra thanks for taking the time to read the documentation.

Feel free to pick up and work on anything. Code needs to be written, pages need to be designed, and features need to be imagined.

Have questions? Create an issue!

## Issue Tracking

Most of the tasks that need to be completed are introduced as *Issues*.  These issues can be bug reports, feature requests, requests for documentation, or tasks that just need to be performed.

As a new contributor to the project, please create issues before working on something.  It helps keep things transparent and gives any code owners time to consider and comment on the issue.

## Pull Requests

The sequence for submitting a Pull Request is:
1. Create a new branch, based on `dev`.
2. Do whatever you want in this branch while developing. 
3. Clean up your commits when you are done developing. A commit should represent a unit of work. Use concise, descriptive commit messages. Multiple commits are okay.
4. Rebase your branch with the latest commits from `dev`.
5. Submit a Pull Request to merge back into `dev`.

     * Pull Requests should rest for at least 48 hours before approval. This gives everyone time to reflect on the changes.

     * It's highly encouraged to improve upon your Pull Request during the 48-hour resting period. It's part of what the resting period is for.

     * All Pull Requests should have a description written by the author. Describe your change in plain English.

6. Verify your branch is deleted from Github after your Pull Request is accepted and merged.
